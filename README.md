## Notes for Collaborator

- &#x2714; **`Problem`**: In the current `index.html` their is just single `div` of class attribute *result* which has to be dynamic, that is, the number of div has to increase as per the number of product retrieved from websites. So your task is to implement logic such that if  `2` datas are retrieved then two div of `result` is to be created and if  `3` datas are retrieved then three `result` div must be created and so on. 
  
- [ ] **Current Problem**: The main task now is to implement the web scrapping idea either by using `bs4` or `selenium` of python and then pass this scrapped data to our webpages inorder to display it; along with it we need to create a model that would store the uploaded files and maintain it at the server side.
